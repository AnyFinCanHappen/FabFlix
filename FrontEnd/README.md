# CS122B - Frontend HW6

### Pre-Setup (Optional but strongly recommended)

1. Install Visual Studio Code
2. Install the following addons (and any other addons you would like)

- Prettier - Code formatter (This will automatically format your code as you write)
- React Native Tools - Helps with writing some repetitive code

### Setup instructions

1. Download and install node.js - Current version: 13.1.0
2. Type `npm` in your terminal to ensure you correctly installed node
3. Type `npm install` within the root of this repo to install all the dependencies (This will take a while)
4. Type `npm start` to start the server and you should have a window open with the front end
5. [In case of error] If you run into a missing dependency error try `npm install` again then `npm start` if the problem persists manually install the dependency it is asking for.
